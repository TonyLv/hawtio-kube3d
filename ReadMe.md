## Angry Pods

This plugin adds a 3d view to [hawtio-kubernetes](https://github.com/hawtio/hawtio-kubernetes) using <a href="http://voxeljs.com/">voxel.js</a>

By default pods won't actually be destroyed when you destroy them in the game, however you can turn that on in the preferences to test the resiliance of your system.  You can also turn off the music in the preferences as well.  Settings for the game are under the 'user' menu under 'Angry Pods'
